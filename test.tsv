Signal	Source	Description
PCLK	Clock source	Clock. The rising edge of PCLK times all transfers on the APB.
PRESETn	System bus equivalent	Reset. The APB reset signal is active LOW. This signal is normally connected
""		directly to the system bus reset signal.
PADDR	APB bridge	Address. This is the APB address bus. It can be up to 32 bits wide and is driven
""		by the peripheral bus bridge unit.
PSELx	APB bridge	Select. The APB bridge unit generates this signal to each peripheral bus slave.
""		It indicates that the slave device is selected and that a data transfer is required.
""		There is a PSELx signal for each slave.
PENABLE	APB bridge	Enable. This signal indicates the second and subsequent cycles of an APB
""		transfer.
PWRITE	APB bridge	Direction. This signal indicates an APB write access when HIGH and an APB
""		read access when LOW.
